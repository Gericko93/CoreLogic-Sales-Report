# Recomendations

# Sales Trend Recomendation

**Leverage Weekend Traffic:**

Since Saturday and Sunday account for nearly 40% of purchases, CoreLogic should:

- Schedule major promotions or flash sales for weekends.

- Launch email and social media campaigns on Friday afternoons to boost visibility heading into high-traffic days.

**Boost Midweek Engagement:**

Wednesday and Thursday are underperforming. The company should try:

- Midweek-only discounts (e.g., “Wednesday Deal Zone”).

- Gamified shopping experiences or limited-time deals to incentivize purchases.

# Device-Level Strategy

**Double Down on Smartphones:**

With $29.1 million in sales, smartphones are clearly the best-sellingp product. To maximize revenue:

- Create smartphone kits (e.g., phone + case + screen protector) to increase order value.

- Highlight bestsellers and trending phones on the homepage.

# Upsell Lower-Performing Categories:

Considering that Headphones with $5.4M are selling only 6.35% of sales, CoreLogic could try new approaches with that product, such as:

- Bundling headphones with smartphones or tablets.

- Featuring limited-edition or branded headphones to drive interest.

- Offer “accessory discounts” for customers who already bought major devices.
